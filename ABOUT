This is a project to make XSL templates to scrape content from several popular
websites and convert it into machine-understandable RDF. Obviously there will be
multiple page types on each website, and all of the relevant templates must be
kept up to date. If I haven't updated the project in awhile, chances are the
templates will not work.
